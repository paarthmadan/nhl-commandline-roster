##### A command line interface, created by Paarth Madan, using Node.js

  - Fetches players on respective teams
  - Fetches players background information, and current statistics (+/- , points, goals etc.)
  - Categorizes stats based on number (EG: points > 50, colour = red)
  - Easy and short terminal commands, for fast and efficient stat watching!

### Current Status
